## Guides List

### Creating A New Game

This assumes that you have installed the game and the mod as well, go to the [setup page](setup.md) if you haven't already.
Once the game is loaded and you have entered the title screen, select the new game button to open the new game menu (also known as the character customization menu).
You can use wasd keys to navigate through the menus and `Control + Enter` or `[` key to select a button or other UI elements. 
Once you're in the new game menu, use the left and right arrow keys to go to next or previous element and again, `Control + Enter` or `[` key to select it.
Check the full list of keybindings in this menu [here](keybindings.md/#new-game-or-character-customization-menu-keys).
In case of a text box, first select the element with `[` or `Control + Enter` and then type the text you want and press `Escape` key to unselect the text box.
And in case of a slider, use up and down arrow keys or page up and page down keys to change the value.
By default, options related to character appearance are hidden, press `Left Control + Space` to make it visible and then you can edit the farmer's appearance.
When you're done with the configuration, go to the `ok` button and select it which will trigger the intro cutscene (unless you've enabled `skip intro` option which will skip it).

### Navigating The World And The Menus

### Saving The Progress

To save the progress you have to sleep in the bed at the farm house and to do that, you have to walk into the bed which will open up a dialogue box asking to sleep.
A thing to note is the you can't walk into the bed from the top or bottom as the headboard and footboard will block the path.
You can also use `debug wh` or `debug warphome` command which will teleport you directly to the bed and then you can move one block to left and again move towards right to trigger the dialogue.

### Using The Tile Viewer Feature

With this feature you can browse the map tile by tile without moving the player.
Because the feature moves and snaps the mouse cursor to the tiles, it can also be used to place certain furnitures which might be difficult to place normally like a t.v., rug, calendar on the wall, etc.
You can use the arrow keys on keyboard to use this feature and if you are using a controller you can also remap these to your controller's buttons from the `config.json`.
While using this feature, you can also press `left control + enter` to auto move the player to the focused tile if possible, this can come in handy in places like mines.
Look at the [keybindings](keybindings.md/#tile-viewer-keys) and [configs](config.md/#tile-viewer-configs) of this feature.
